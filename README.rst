As per :

(i) looking for packets with an ICMPv6 Type field of 134 indicating Router Advertisements 
(ii) an ICMPv6 Option field of 25 indicating Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS). 
(iii) If this RDNSS option also has a length field value that is even, the heuristic would drop or flag the associated packet, as it is likely part of a Bad Neighbor exploit attempt.
